# AI-ML-Analyst-Journey
my 3 month learning journey


# Day 1 – January 19  

## 📌 Focus for the Day
Understanding how Python is used in Data Analysis and AI.

## 📚 Concepts Learned
- Why Python is preferred for Data Analysis and AI
- Role of Python libraries:
  - NumPy → numerical operations
  - Pandas → data handling and analysis
  - Matplotlib → data visualization
  - Scikit-learn → basic machine learning

## 🛠️ Practice Done
- Revised basic Python syntax
- Understood how data flows:
  Raw Data → Cleaning → Analysis → Insights

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Python is not just a programming language, it is a **tool for thinking with data**
- An analyst’s job is more about **understanding data** than writing complex code




# Day 2–3 – January 21  

## 📌 Focus for the Day
Practicing user input handling, type conversion, and decision-making logic in Python.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Taking user input and understanding data types

- Conditional logic using if–elif–else

## 🛠️ Practice Done
- Implemented programs combining input, type conversion, and conditions
- Focused on clean code, logical flow, and readability
- Refactored code to reduce redundancy and improve clarity

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Proper type handling is critical for accurate logic
- Conditional statements drive real-world decision making
- Clean and readable code improves problem-solving efficiency
