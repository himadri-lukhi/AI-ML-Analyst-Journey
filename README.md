# AI-ML-Analyst-Journey
my 3 month learning journey


# Day 1 – January 19  

## 📌 Focus 
Understanding how Python is used in Data Analysis and AI.

## 📚 Concepts 
- Why Python is preferred for Data Analysis and AI
- Role of Python libraries:
  - NumPy → numerical operations
  - Pandas → data handling and analysis
  - Matplotlib → data visualization
  - Scikit-learn → basic machine learning

## 🛠️ Practice 
- Revised basic Python syntax
- Understood how data flows:
  Raw Data → Cleaning → Analysis → Insights

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Python is not just a programming language, it is a **tool for thinking with data**
- An analyst’s job is more about **understanding data** than writing complex code




# Day 2–3 – January 21  

## 📌 Focus 
Practicing user input handling, type conversion, and decision-making logic in Python.

## 📚 Concepts 
- Taking user input and understanding data types
- Type conversion using int, float, and str
- Conditional logic using if–elif–else

## 🛠️ Practice 
- Implemented programs combining input, type conversion, and conditions
- Focused on clean code, logical flow, and readability
- Refactored code to reduce redundancy and improve clarity

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Proper type handling is critical for accurate logic
- Conditional statements drive real-world decision making
- Clean and readable code improves problem-solving efficiency


# Day 4–5 – January 23  

## 📌 Focus
Practicing loops and control flow in Python.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- for and while loops
- Conditions inside loops
- break and continue

## 🛠️ Practice 
- Wrote loop-based programs
- Combined loops with conditional logic
- Improved logical flow and readability

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Loops automate repetitive tasks efficiently
- Logic matters more than syntax
- Small mistakes in conditions can change outputs




# Day 6–7 – January 26  

## 📌 Focus 
Working with core data structures and improving code reusability.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Dictionaries (key–value data handling)
- Sets (unique values and operations)
- Functions for modular and reusable code

## 🛠️ Practice 
- Used dictionaries to manage structured data
- Applied sets for uniqueness and comparison
- Wrote functions to reduce repetition and improve clarity

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Dictionaries model real-world data effectively
- Sets handle uniqueness efficiently
- Functions keep code clean, organized, and scalable
